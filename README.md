A very fast and lightweight, standards-compliant, self-hosted javascript parser with high focus on both performance and stability.

## [Demo](https://cherow.github.io/cherow/) and [Benchmark](https://cherow.github.io/cherow/performance/)


## Features

* Conforms to the standard ECMAScriptÂ® 2019 [(ECMA-262 9th Edition)](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/) language specification (*draft*)
* Support for all stage 3 proposals via option.
* JSX support via option.
* Experimental feature support via option.
* Optionally track syntactic node locations
* Emits an [ESTree-compatible](https://github.com/estree/estree) abstract syntax tree.
* Very well tested (~26 000 [unit tests](https://github.com/cherow/cherow/tree/master/test) with [full code coverage)](https://coveralls.io/github/cherow/cherow))
* Supports all module loaders
* Lightweight - ~70 KB minified (*18 kb smaller than Acorn*)

## ESNext features

`Stage 3` features support. These need to be enabled with the `next` option.

* [Import()](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import)
* [Hashbang Grammar](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-hashbang)
* [Private methods and getter/setters for JavaScript classes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-private-methods)
* [BigInt](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint)
* [Import.meta](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-meta)

## API

Cherow generates AST according to [ESTree AST format](https://github.com/estree/estree), and can be used to perform [syntactic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) (parsing) of a JavaScript program, and with ES2015 and later a JavaScript program can be either [a script or a module](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-scripts-and-modules).

The `parse` method exposed by Cherow takes an optional `options` object which allows you to specify whether to parse in [`script`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/#sec-parse-script) mode (the default) or in [`module`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/8.0/#sec-parsemodule) mode.


Here is a quick example to parse a script:

```js

cherow.parseScript('g_plane = chinese');

// or

cherow.parse('x = async() => { for await (x of xs); }');

```

This will return when serialized in json:

```js
{
    body: [{
        expression: {
            left: {
                name: 'x',
                type: 'Identifier'
            },
            operator: '=',
            right: {
                async: true,
                body: {
                    body: [{
                        await: true,
                        body: {
                            type: 'EmptyStatement',
                        },
                        left: {
                            name: 'x',
                            type: 'Identifier',
                        },
                        right: {
                            name: 'xs',
                            type: 'Identifier',
                        },
                        type: 'ForOfStatement',
                    }],
                    type: 'BlockStatement'
                },
                expression: false,
                generator: false,
                id: null,
                params: [],
                type: 'ArrowFunctionExpression'
            },
            type: 'AssignmentExpression'
        },
        type: 'ExpressionStatement'
    }],
    sourceType: 'script',
    type: 'Program'
}
```

## Bug reporting

If you caught a bug, don't hesitate to report it in the issue tracker. From the moment I respond to you, it will take maximum 60 minutes before the bug is fixed.

Note that I will try to respond to you within one hour. Sometimes it can take a bit longer. I'm not allways online. And if I find out it
will take more then 60 minutes to solve your issue, you will be notified.

I know how irritating it can be if you are writing code and encounter bugs in your dependencies. And even more frustrating if you need to wait weeks or days.


## Rationale

Existing parsers have many issues with them:

* `Acorn` is the most commonly used tool out there because of its support for recent ES standards, but it's slow and it often is too permissive in what it accepts. It's also not optimized for handheld devices.

* `Esprima` is a little faster than Acorn, but it's almost never updated, and their test suite has too many invalid tests. It also doesn't support recent ES standards.

* `Babylon` is highly coupled to Babel, and is comparatively very slow and buggy, and failing to correctly handle even stable ECMAScript standard features.

None of these parsers would fare any chance against the official Test262 suite, and most fail a substantial number of them.

We figured we could *try* do better. *We* are used in plural form because Cherow is developed by a main developer and two
others "*behind the scenes*" that contributes with their knowledge whenever it's necessary.
